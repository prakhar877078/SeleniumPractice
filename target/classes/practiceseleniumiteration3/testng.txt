TestNG is a testing framework for Java that allows developers to write and run tests in a flexible and powerful way. 
TestNG provides several annotations that help to control the behavior of test methods and the test suite. 
Here are some commonly used TestNG annotations:

@Test: This annotation is used to mark a method as a test method. 
TestNG will execute all the methods marked with this annotation.

@BeforeSuite: This annotation is used to mark a method that should be run before all tests in the suite.

@AfterSuite: This annotation is used to mark a method that should be run after all tests in the suite.

@BeforeTest: This annotation is used to mark a method that should be run before any test method 
belonging to the current <test> tag in the testng.xml file.

@AfterTest: This annotation is used to mark a method that should be run after all the test methods 
belonging to the current <test> tag in the testng.xml file.

@BeforeClass: This annotation is used to mark a method that should be run before the first test method 
in the current class.

@AfterClass: This annotation is used to mark a method that should be run after all the test methods 
in the current class.

@BeforeMethod: This annotation is used to mark a method that should be run before each test method.

@AfterMethod: This annotation is used to mark a method that should be run after each test method.

@DataProvider: This annotation is used to mark a method that provides data to a test method.

@Parameters: This annotation is used to pass parameters to a test method.

@Listeners: This annotation is used to attach listeners to the test class.

@Factory: This annotation is used to create test classes dynamically.

@Ignore: This annotation is used to skip a test method.
